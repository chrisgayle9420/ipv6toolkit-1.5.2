SI6 Networks IPv6 Toolkit v1.5.2

   * All: Add support for GNU Debian/kfreebsd
     The toolkit would not build on GNU Debian/kfreebsd before this release.

   * tcp6: Add support for TCP/IPv6 probes
     tcp6 can now send TCP/IPv6 packets ("--probe-mode" option), and read the 
     TCP response packets, if any. This can be leveraged for port scans, and
     miscellaneous measurements.

SI6 Networks IPv6 Toolkit v1.5.1
   * Fix Mac OS breakage
     libipv6.h had incorrect definitions for "struct tcp_hdr".

SI6 Networks IPv6 Toolkit v1.5

   * All: Improved the next-hop determination
     Since the toolkit employs lipcap (as there is no portable way to forge
     IPv6 addresses and do other tricks), it was relying on the user specifying
     a network interface ("-i" was mandatory for all tools) and that routers
     would send Router Advertisements on the local links. This not only was 
     rather inconventient for users (specifying a network interace was not 
     warranted), but also meant that in setups where RAs where not available
     (e.g., manual configuration), the tools would fail. The toolkit now
     eploys routing sockets (in BSDs) or Netlink (in Linux), and only uses
     "sending RAs" as a fall-back in case of failure (IPv6 not configured on
     the local host).

   * All: Improved source address selection
     This is closely related to the previous bullet.

   * All: More code moved to libipv6
     More and more code was moved to libipv6 and removed to the individual tool
     source files. As wiht some of the above, this was painful and
     time-consuming, but was necessary -- and in the long run it will make
     code maintenance easier.

   * All: libipv6 used throughout all tools
     This was rather painful and non-exciting, but necessary.


SI6 Networks' IPv6 Toolkit v1.4.1

   * frag6: Fixed bug that prevented Ethernet header from being filled
     A bug in the code caused Ethernet frames to go on te wire without any of
     their header fields completed.

   * All: Use of library to avoid code replication
     An "libipv6" library was created, such that common functions do not need
     to be replicated for each tool. ni6, ns6, rs6, and tcp6 now employ such
     library.


SI6 Networks' IPv6 Toolkit v1.4 release

   * frag6: Fixed the flooding option
     Fixed the fragment size used when employing the flooding option. It was 
     prevously sending fragment sizes that where not a multiple of eight, and
     hence these fragments were dropped.

   * scan6: Added support for 64-bit encoding of IPv4 addresses
     Option "--tgt-ipv4" was augmented to support both encodings (32 bit
     and 64 bit) of embedded IPv4 addresses.

   * tcp6: Fixed response to Neighbor Solicitations
     tcp6 was not responding to incomming Neighbor Solicitations. Hence, when
     packets were sent from spoofed addresses, tcp6 would never receive the
     response packets, because the NSs sent by the local router or target node
     would never be responded.

   * tcp6: Added support for TCP Window-based attacks
     tcp6 can now close the window after sending an app-layer command, and
     also "modulate" the TCP window to circumvent trivial mitigations for these
     attacks ("--window-mode" and "--win-modulate" options).

   * tcp6: Support for multiple connection-establishment types
     tcp6 can now cause e.g. TCP simultaneous opens (see the "--open-mode"
     option).

   * tcp6: Support for multiple connection-termination types
     tcp6 can now perform multiple connection-termination types (see the
     "--close-mode" option).

   * tcp6: Support for sending application layer requests
     tcp6 can now send application-layer requests with the "--data" option.

   * Many improvements to the manual pages.
     Fixed the troff encoding of many manual pages. Added ipv6toolkit(7), that
     describes a general description of the toolkit.

   * All: Fixed bug in link-layer destination address selection
     Tools now try to find a local router or perform Neighbor Discovery only
     when necessary (i.e., underlying link-layer is *not* loopback or tunnel,
     destination address is *not* link-local, and a link-layer destination
     address has *not* been specified).

   * All: Fixed bug in option handling
     Incorrect data type was used for the return value of getopt_long(), thus 
     leading to problems in some architectures.

   * All: Fixed a number of issues with pcap_next_ex()
     The timeout parameter of pcap_next_ex() is now based on the platform (the
     previous constant value had different semantics in different platforms).
     Additionally, handle the case where pcap_next_ex() returns no packets.

   * All: General improvements and clean-up
     The development process now includes building the toolkit with the clang
     compiler (in addition to gcc), which has lead to the identification of a
     number of issues.

   * All: Improved support for building the toolkit.
     The toolkit now contains one makefile for pmake, and another for GNU make.
     Added support for the DESTDIR variable. Appropriate paths are selected
     based on the value of a number of variables. Configuration file is
     dynamically generated, with the right path to the oui.txt file.
